# Timer


Google has removed Stopwatch and Timer features on their Search Service recently so I decided to make them myself. By using ``setInterval`` in JavaScript we can easily make our Timer, it allows the function to run repeatedly, starting after the interval of time (likes 1 second), then repeating continuously at that interval. Stopwatch will be available soon!
