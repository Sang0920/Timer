# Timer


Google has removed Stop-watch and Timer features on their Search service recently so I decided to make them my own. By using ``setInterval`` in JavaScript we can easily make our Timer, it allows the function to run repeatedly, starting after the interval of time (like 1 second), then repeating continuously at that interval. Stopwatch will be available soon!
